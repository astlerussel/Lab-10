#Steps to create a jupyter notebook
This will open Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser.

Step 1: Create a New Notebook
Once Jupyter Notebook is running, you will see the Jupyter dashboard in your web browser. On the right side, you'll find a "New" button. Click on the "New" button, and a drop-down menu will appear.

Step 2: Select Python Notebook
In the drop-down menu, click on "Python 3" under the "Notebook" section. This will create a new Jupyter Notebook with the Python kernel.

Step 3: Name your Notebook
The new notebook will open in a new tab, and you can see the name "Untitled" at the top. To give your notebook a meaningful name, click on the "Untitled" text and enter the desired name.

Step 4: Start Coding
Now, you have a new Jupyter Notebook ready to use. You can start coding in the cells provided. Jupyter Notebooks allow you to write and execute code, view results, and add text and visualizations.

Step 5: Save your Notebook
Remember to save your work regularly by clicking on the "Save" button (disk icon) or using the "Ctrl + S" shortcut. This will save your notebook as a .ipynb file in the current working directory.

Step 6: Close the Notebook
To close a Jupyter Notebook, you can either click on the "Close and Halt" option in the File menu or simply close the browser tab.
